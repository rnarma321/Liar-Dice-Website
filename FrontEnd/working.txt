Rules for Liar's Dice:







Our version:


* Played with 4 players
* Each player has five dice, for a total max of 20
* On each round, everyone roles all of their dice and keeps the results hidden
* First player will guess how many total of one dice face were rolled
  * Iterates through the rest of the players: Bet (increases dice face number or pip), Challenge (Reveals to see if the current bet is true), exact (claims exact of a certain number of dice)
